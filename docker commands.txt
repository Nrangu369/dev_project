1 create a docker image from docker file

--> docker build -t my-image .

2 Create a Container From an existing Image

--> docker run -it -d <image-name>

-d = Detached mode, means Docker container runs in the background of your terminal.

3 create a Docker container through command line.

--> docker container run -d --name=nginx-container nginx-image2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

docker tag <repository name/image-name:version>

docker tag rangu369/myimage123:V1.0

doker push rangu369/myimage123:V1.0
===================================================


master and slave configuration steps:

1 install two ec2 instances
one for master and one for slave node, after launching instances you need to install java on both the instances

2 on master node 
install jenkins and after setting up jenkins default dashboard.
3 next Create a user and generate ssh keys on slave node 
4 afterwards Copy keys on master node at /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
5 Join slave node to master
To join the 
slave node to Jenkins Master, go to Manage jenkins go to nodes and create a new node 
there u can give <node name > and as per ur requirement Number of executors - 1 u can 
6 add Remote root directory - /home/prayag < This is the workspace directory for agent, where it stores data downloaded by the Job>

7 Usage - Use this mode as much as possible

8 Launch method - Launch agents via SSH

9 Host - 192.168.0.103

10 Credentials - use ssh username / private key options

11 Host Key Verification Strategy - Know hosts key strategy

12 Save and check that new slave node is added and is in sync

finally we can see We can see Jenkins Slave is launching .. Agent status - "is being launched"
================================================================================================

Q. where can you modify in jenkins jobs should be run on slave node?

suppose u can choose free style project >> in general section >> there u can see <Restrict where this project can be run)

there u can select ur jenkins slave. which ur already created.
